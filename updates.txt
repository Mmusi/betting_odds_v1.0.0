If you want, I can also add:

⭐ Click-to-highlight which bets win across all outcomes
⭐ A "Best hedge suggestion" panel
⭐ Export stake plan to Betway slip (copy-paste friendly)
⭐ CSV/PDF save of stake allocation

 Also copy team names and add them below Match 1 or simply repalce Match 1 match 2 with team names.
 

Just tell me!

A. Add a Bet History log ("Slip Records")

Every solve + applied outcome saved into a journal.

B. Add Cashout simulator

Enter partial winnings → bankroll adjusts.

C. Add Auto-Recommendation Engine

Select which combos give highest net vs risk.

D. Multi-match ACCA (true accumulators)

We can enable real parlay multipliers.
