If you want, I can also add:

⭐ Click-to-highlight which bets win across all outcomes
⭐ A "Best hedge suggestion" panel
⭐ Export stake plan to Betway slip (copy-paste friendly)
⭐ CSV/PDF save of stake allocation

 Also copy team names and add them below Match 1 or simply repalce Match 1 match 2 with team names.
 

Just tell me!

A. Add a Bet History log ("Slip Records")

Every solve + applied outcome saved into a journal.

B. Add Cashout simulator

Enter partial winnings → bankroll adjusts.

C. Add Auto-Recommendation Engine

Select which combos give highest net vs risk.

D. Multi-match ACCA (true accumulators)

We can enable real parlay multipliers.

✅ Auto-return bankroll after win

For Results - when recording after placing bets on 6 diffirent odds or outcomes. most of times i monitor game
and cashout where I feel there are no more opportunities to save . for example If I bet P1 on all six options 
and during the game I think the game will end as a draw. i cashout on Home team winning bet , Away team winning bet 
and on double chance winning bet. leaving draw bet , home team win or draw double chance and Away team double chance.
I want this logic and other logic included in my cashout options and accordinlgly update bankroll.
In Solver section, there is need for a back link to calculate odd under analyze (2).
